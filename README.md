# OCR
Optical Character Recognition app. Allows the user to scan a picture and converts it to text<br>
The following is a picture of what the user's screen looks like:
The top 70% of the screen is what the camera sees<br>
The bottom part where it says: "Bring a romantic starry night" is the scanned output for that picture<br>
Finally the option at the top is just there to let the user retake the picture
